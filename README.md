# Moco_Result

Here a repository with all the results from the various tests and run of my thesis project [MocoLoco](https://github.com/EMoreschi/MocoLoco) (here the link to the repository).

The data will be divided in different folders:
* **False positive tests** where there are all the false positive rate in different usage of the code
* **Implanting tests** where there are some plots from implanting a known matrix inside random sequences
* **Biological results** where I collect all the results found by the tool with literature knonwn colocalization.

That's all.
